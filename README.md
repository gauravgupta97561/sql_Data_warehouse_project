# sql_Data_warehouse_project
Modern Data Warehouse implementation using Azure Data Studio, featuring ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics workflows.

🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a scalable, modular, and efficient SQL-based Data Warehouse that can:
Consolidate data from various sources
Transform raw data into meaningful information using ETL pipelines
Apply robust data modeling techniques (Star/Snowflake schemas)
Enable downstream reporting and analytics using Business Intelligence tools
Serve as a learning template or reference architecture for real-world DWH solutions

⚙️ Specifications
📁 Data Source
Sample transactional datasets (e.g., sales, customer, product)
CSV/flat files or simulated sources used for development
Can be extended to pull from APIs, databases, or cloud storage

✅ Data Quality
Includes data validation steps in ETL (e.g., null checks, deduplication, type casting)
Consistent naming conventions, primary/foreign key enforcement
Logging mechanisms for tracking data anomalies

🔌 Integration
Built and tested using Azure Data Studio
SQL scripts are modular and follow a repeatable ETL framework
Supports integration with:
Azure SQL Database
